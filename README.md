# Football-Data.co.uk analysis-ready data
A series of R scripts to clean and preprocces Football-Data.co.uk data.

This is the url for the Spanish data: https://www.football-data.co.uk/spainm.php 
In the website you can find data from a ton of leagues.

I hope this repository helps to get the data and shows how to import multiple files into RStudio. Also, as not every file has the same number of variables, I will provide the code to tidily join files, merging different season of the same league or even different leagues.
